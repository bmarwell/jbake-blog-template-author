= JBake Blog Setup with Author Theme
:toc:
:idprefix:
:icons: font

This repository contains the brilliant link:https://de.wordpress.org/themes/author/[Author theme from Ben Sibley], originally written for WordPress.

== Features

Author theme::
The Author theme was ported by me, including a rewrite of the JavaScript files to not use jQuery.
No jQuery::
Yes, I got rid of all jQuery.
Really. +
_However_, shariff-plus still uses jQuery internally.
Follow https://github.com/richard67/shariff-plus/pull/22 and I will integrate it the moment it is ready!
Multi-Language-Support::
While the blog roll (index) will show all languages, the posts itselves can contain a language idicator and a link to the translations.
Metadata will be added where appropriate.
Minification::
The new behaviour since 2023-05-11 is:
Images will not be optimized on build. Instead, run `./mvnw com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:yarn@optimize-images` to optimize all images in the `target/website` folder.
Featured Images::
You can include a featured image and even select the display type for twitter and linkedin!
Simple Light Box::
All your images will be opened in a mobile friendly lightbox when clicking them.
Just make sure to add a link attribute to your image block or inline image.
Open Graph Metadata::
Metadata for Twitter, Facebook etc. will automatically be inserted when available.
Fallback options are available, too.
JSON-LD support::
Have crawlers read your data in a JSON format for linked data, based on schema.org.
WP-Appbox port::
You can insert links to the following stores via macro (incomplete):
* Google Play Store
* More to come
Shariff sharing buttons::
These sharing buttons do not compromise your security: No I-Frames or other injected code from the servers. +
You can also enable shariff per page using `:jbake-shariff: true`.
YAML-based menu::
The menu can be defined using YAML.
No writing of complicated HTML anymore.
Tag page descriptions::
You can define descriptions for your tag page for better SEO visibility.
Matomo tracking::
Enable Matomo tracking for your blog with just three settings (`enabled`, `url`, `site_id`).
GDPR cookie consent::
If either GitHub comments (giscus) or Analytics (Matomo) or both are enabled, a GDPR cookie consent banner will be shown.

== Setup instructions

1. Go through the link:jbake.properties[] file and edit everything you need.
Some options can be disabled entirely, some cannot.
Most options should have comments by now.
2. Go through the files in `src/site/data`.
 * link:src/site/data/authors.yaml[]:
   Define at lease one author, this is mandatory.
   Spelling matters, you must use the exact spelling everywhere.
 * link:src/site/data/keywords.yaml[]:
   Keywords are optional.
   You can add descriptions for the tags pages here.
   If not defined here, the tag page will just be missing the description.
 * link:src/site/data/license.yaml[]:: Edit the license according to your need.
   This will be applied to all CONTENT YOU WRITE, not to any of this repository.
 * link:src/site/data/socialmedia.yaml[]:
   You can define which buttons to show below your avatar.


== Writing Posts and Pages

This section will only cover the AsciiDoc format.

=== AsciiDoc examples

The following snippet is a sample header for your asciidoc posts:

* The license is optional and specific for this content, but should in general be the same as defined in the license.yaml file.
* Dates *MUST* be written in the ISO format, timezone UTC.
* `lang` can be set to a two-letter ISO code (de, en) or can contain a region, separated by a hyphen.
* Tags are a comma separated list of keywords. A keyword index will be created, as well as a page for each keyword.
* If no featured image is present, the default featured image from link:jbake.properties[] will be used.
* toc, idprefix and icons are optional. Remove or adjust to your liking.

== Adding twitter widgets

This template supports adding timelines and tweets.
This can be done using Twitters embed function.

You can also link a specific tweet, which is probably the more common option.
Just use Twitters/Xs embed code.

=== WP Appbox

This is supported via HTML only, most data needs to be inserted by hand.
A freemarker macro is in the making.

=== Simple Lightbox

All images should open in a simple lightbox on click.

=== Custom robots.txt

Delete the file `/src/site/content/robots.adoc` and create a file `/src/site/assets/robots.txt` instead.

== Publishing

Compile your website using `./mvnw package`.
This will also run `sharp` (an alternative to `imagemin`) and compress all images.

If you want a live preview instead, use `./mvnw prepare-package jbake:inline`.
In case you do not need hot code reload, just start a web server in `target/website` and run `./mvnw prepare-package` - this will skip the image optimization process which can take a while.

== Roadmap

* Appbox support
* Better sitemap support.
* Touch icon support
* Fix a lot of HTML errors, e.g.
 ** span with href
 ** img without alt
 ** img resolution attributes with "px" suffix
 ** unencoded paths in href attributes to tags
* Identify index sites and add metadata (e.g. lang attribute).
