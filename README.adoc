= JBake Blog Setup with Author Theme
:toc:
:idprefix:
:icons: font

This repository contains the brilliant link:https://de.wordpress.org/themes/author/[Author theme from Ben Sibley], originally written for WordPress.

== Features

Author theme::
The Author theme was ported by me, including a rewrite of the JavaScript files to not use jQuery.
No jQuery::
Yes, I got rid of all jQuery.
Really.
Multi-Language-Support::
While the blog roll (index) will show all languages, the posts itselves can contain a language idicator and a link to the translations.
Metadata will be added where appropriate.
Minification::
The new behaviour since 2023-05-11 is:
Images will not be optimized on build. Instead, run `./mvnw com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:yarn@optimize-images` to optimize all images in the `src/site` folder.
+
The old behaviour was:
When building with Apache Maven, all local CSS, JS, images(!) and HTML files will be minified.
You can skip the HTML and image minifcation step by using `./mvnw package -Dsite.postprocess.skip=true`.
Featured Images::
You can include a featured image and even select the display type for twitter and linkedin!
Simple Light Box::
All your images will be opened in a mobile friendly lightbox when clicking them.
Just make sure to add a link attribute to your image block or inline image.
Open Graph Metadata::
Metadata for Twitter, Facebook etc. will automatically be inserted when available.
Fallback options are available, too.
JSON-LD support::
Have crawlers read your data in a JSON format for linked data, based on schema.org.
WP-Appbox port::
You can insert links to the following stores via macro (incomplete):
* Google Play Store
* More to come
Shariff sharing buttons::
These sharing buttons do not compromise your security: No I-Frames or other injected code from the servers.
YAML-based menu::
The menu can be defined using YAML.
No writing of complicated HTML anymore.
Tag page descriptions::
You can define descriptions for your tag page for better SEO visibility.


== Setup instructions

1. Go through the link:jbake.properties[] file and edit everything you need.
Some options can be disabled entirely, some cannot.
Most options should have comments by now.
2. Go through the files in `src/site/data`.
 * link:src/site/data/authors.yaml[]:
   Define at lease one author, this is mandatory.
   Spelling matters, you must use the exact spelling everywhere.
 * link:src/site/data/keywords.yaml[]:
   Keywords are optional.
   You can add descriptions for the tags pages here.
   If not defined here, the tag page will just be missing the description.
 * link:src/site/data/license.yaml[]:: Edit the license according to your need.
   This will be applied to all CONTENT YOU WRITE, not to any of this repository.
 * link:src/site/data/socialmedia.yaml[]:
   You can define which buttons to show below your avatar.


== Writing Posts and Pages

This section will only cover the AsciiDoc format.

=== AsciiDoc examples

The following snippet is a sample header for your asciidoc posts:

[source,asciidoc]

// This work is licensed under a
// <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.

* The license is optional and specific for this content, but should in general be the same as defined in the license.yaml file.
* Dates *MUST* be written in the ISO format, timezone UTC.
* `lang` can be set to a two-letter ISO code (de, en) or can contain a region, separated by a hyphen.
* Tags are a comma separated list of keywords. A keyword index will be created, as well as a page for each keyword.
* If no featured image is present, the default featured image from link:jbake.properties[] will be used.
* toc, idprefix and icons are optional. Remove or adjust to your liking.

== Adding twitter widgets

This template supports adding timelines and tweets.

One option is to include a timeline. At the moment, there is no freemarker macro,
but an HTML passthrough will do.

Be sure to add the classes "twitter" and "timeline".
The `data-twitter-timeline-id` is the actual source for the generated timeline.
As a fallback, you can insert or link the referenced timeline.

<div class="twitter timeline wp-block" data-twitter-timeline-id="bmarwell"><a href="https://twitter.com/bmarwell">https://twitter.com/bmarwell</a></div>
++++
----

You can also link a specific tweet.
Instead of the timeline class, use the `tweet` class.
Again, you can optionally add some fallback content.

</div>
++++

=== WP Appbox

This is supported via HTML only, most data needs to be inserted by hand.
A freemarker macro is in the making.

=== Simple Lightbox

All images should open in a simple lightbox on click.

=== Custom robots.txt

Delete the file `/src/site/content/robots.adoc` and create a file `/src/site/assets/robots.txt` instead.

== Publishing

Compile your website using `./mvnw package`.
Then optionally compress all media using `./mvnw com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:yarn@optimize-images`.

If you want a live preview instead, use `./mvnw generate-resources jbake:inline`.

== Roadmap

* Appbox support
* Better sitemap support.
* Touch icon support
* Fix a lot of HTML errors, e.g.
 ** span with href
 ** img without alt
 ** img resolution attributes with "px" suffix
 ** unencoded paths in href attributes to tags
* Identify index sites and add metadata (e.g. lang attribute).
