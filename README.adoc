:icons: font

This repository contains the brilliant link:https://de.wordpress.org/themes/author/[Author theme from Ben Sibley], originally written for WordPress.

== Features

Author theme::
The Author theme was ported by me, including a rewrite of the JavaScript files to not use jQuery.
No jQuery::
Yes, I got rid of all jQuery.
Really.
Multi-Language-Support::
While the blog roll (index) will show all languages, the posts itselves can contain a language idicator and a link to the translations.
Metadata will be added where appropriate.
Minification::
When building with Apache Maven, all local CSS, JS, images(!) and HTML files will be minified.
You can skip the HTML and image minifcation step by using `./mvnw package -Dsite.postprocess.skip=true`.
Featured Images::
You can include a featured image and even select the display type for twitter and linkedin!
Simple Light Box::
All your images will be opened in a mobile friendly lightbox when clicking them.
Open Graph Metadata::
Metadata for Twitter, Facebook etc. will automatically be inserted when available.
Fallback options are available, too.
JSON-LD support::
Have crawlers read your data in a JSON format for linked data, based on schema.org.
WP-Appbox port::
You can insert links to the following stores via macro (incomplete):
* Google Play Store
* More to come
Shariff sharing buttons::
These sharing buttons do not compromise your security: No I-Frames or other injected code from the servers.
YAML-based menu::
The menu can be defined using YAML.
No writing of complicated HTML anymore.
Tag page descriptions::
You can define descriptions for your tag page for better SEO visibility.


== Usage instructions

=== Initial setup

1. Go through the link:jbake.properties[] file and edit everything you need.
Some options can be disabled entirely, some cannot.
Most options should have comments by now.
2. Go through the files in `src/site/data`.
 * link:src/site/data/authors.yaml[]:
   Define at lease one author, this is mandatory.
   Spelling matters, you must use the exact spelling everywhere.
 * link:src/site/data/keywords.yaml[]:
   Keywords are optional.
   You can add descriptions for the tags pages here.
   If not defined here, the tag page will just be missing the description.
 * link:src/site/data/license.yaml[]:: Edit the license according to your need.
   This will be applied to all CONTENT YOU WRITE, not to any of this repository.
 * link:src/site/data/socialmedia.yaml[]:
   You can define which buttons to show below your avatar.
